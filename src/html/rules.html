Taking damage should be a serious concern and dropping to 0hp represents a near-death experience. These rules are intended to raise the stakes in combat by making injury more serious, and death more likely than in RAW 5e, encouraging players to prepare carefully for each encounter and avoid unecessary risks. </p>

                <li class="list-group-item"><h5 class="rules-heading">Rests:</h5>Short rests take 8 hours. Long rests take 1 week and require a safe space such as a friendly village, town, or castle.</li>
                <li class="list-group-item"><h5 class="rules-heading">Bloodied:</h5>After gaining the Bloodied condition (half hp), a character needs to expend a bandage to be able to spend hit dice during a short rest.</li>
                <li class="list-group-item"><h5 class="rules-heading">Lingering Injuries:</h5>When reduced to 0hp, characters gain a lingering injury that causes exhastion and prevents spending hit dice to heal. Lingering injuries must be treated with medical supplies and a medicine check to patch them up, removing their penalties. However the injury persists, and may reopend when taking damage in combat, until healed during a long rest.</li>

                <li class="list-group-item"><h5 class="rules-heading">Death Saves:</h5>Death saves are rolled as usual, however succeeding a Death Save no longer counts as a success towards stabilisation, it simply avoids a failure. You must be stabilised by someone else, using a medicine check, otherwise you will eventually die.</li>
                <li class="list-group-item"><h5 class="rules-heading">Resurrection:</h5>Resurrection spells are no longer available to players, and as a general rule does not exist in an accessible way in the world. Resurrection may still exist in the world, but only as extremely rare or powerful magic, dangerous bargains, as the byproduct of a terrible curse, etc. If the players really want to resurrect someone, it may be possible but should be a grueling, once-in-a-lifetime quest, and is generally discouraged.</li>

Those who wield it incite both reverance and fear, and may be respected or shunned by turns. Many people may go their whole lives without witnessing true magic, and those who pracice the Art Magic dedicate decades or centuries to its study. These rules represent the inherent danger and uncertainly in drawing on the Power, and are intended to encourage players to be judicious in their usage of magic. Currently, these rules only apply to Cantrips and Spells and do not include magical effects from traits, feats, or class abilities.</p>

The burnout die increases by one step after a short rest, and additional hit dice can be spent during a short rest, each increasing the burnout die by another step. The burnout die resets to its max after a long rest. Currently all classes have a max burnout die of 1d12.</li>
