          <h1>Cursed Ones</h1>
          <p>
            These monsters were once men, or other natural folk, before a magical curse or ancient hex transformed them. In rare cases, their curse may have been passed on from parent to child, or from attacker to victim through a wound. Due to the powerfully magical nature of Cursed Ones, one should take care to approach each case individually, being wary of assumptions or past experiences. Some curses may follow reliable patterns - such as that of the Striga - but even then some details may vary, along with the strength of the curse.
          </p>
          <p>
            Many cases can be cured through the proper dispelling of the curse. Some curses have known cures, although enacting them may be tricky, while others often require the meeting of certain conditions unique to the circumstances under which the afflicted was cursed. Gathering information on how they came to be cursed is often vital.
          </p>
          <p>
            If all else fails, death is the surest cure, although it may not come easily to them, as their curses often bestow terrible strength upon them.

          <p>
            A humanoid cursed with lycanthropy, instilling a thirst for blood and granting the ability to transform into a terrible wolf. Lycanthropes may be either direct results of a magical Curse, born as the offspring of two lycanthropes, or infected when bitten by one already afflicted by lycanthropy. However this last is far rarer than superstition would have you believe as most bites do not transmit the disease. However it is still a possibility and one especially relevant to those who may encounter and fight lycanthropes often.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the case of cursed werewolves, there is a possibility of lifting the curse, although as with all curses, it will be likely be unique, and require a unique solution to lift it, if it is at all possible to lift.
          </p>
          <p>
            Regardless of the source of their lycanthropy, each werewolf is invariably unique, as they are humanoids cursed or diseased with a terrible burden. Some may be unwilling hosts to the bloodlust, while others may embrace it, or even deliberately use it to their advantage. Some may be fully lucid during transformation, while others may remember only fragments, or believing the episodes to be vivid dreams.

          <h1>Draconids</h1>
          <p>
            Dragon. No other monster is as far-famed or feared as the Dragon. Peasants tell tales of their wrath, kings stitch them on their banners, all covet their legendary hoards of treasure. Despite their extreme lethality, the vast majority of true Dragons have been hunted to near extinction by royal armies, huge bands of hunters, and mages seeking their potent blood and organs.
          </p>
          <p>
            Indeed, although they are related, the majority of Draconids are not true Dragons, and many are extremely different. They are however often confused or conflated with Dragons by the uneducated, and by braggarts quick to claim they have slain a Dragon. The Draconids are a broad family of quasi-reptiles that encompasses terrestrial, aerial, and aquatic species.
          </p>
          <p>
            Aerial species are the most numerous - and often most dangerous - of these, roosting in mountain caves, rocky crags, cliff-faces, and occasionally ruined structures. Herd animals, particularly sheep, are their most common prey, and are snatched boldly from fields and pens.
          </p>

          <h4>Medium Dragon (Draconid)</h4>
          <p> 
            Large Draconid (Dragon): Aerial biped with sharp, three-toed claws. Can use wing-tips as forelimbs for crawling and climbing. Long, agile neck with a small snake-like head filled with powerful conical teeth. Long thin tail ending in a very sharp, venomous barb.
          </p>
          <p>
            Found in mountains, cliff-faces, open woodlands. More common in higher altitude areas, but have a wide distribution. Often drawn to pastures and open grassland in search of livestock.
          </p>
          
          <h4 class="bestiary-heading4">Strengths</h4>
          <p>
            Immune to poison, lightning damage; resistant to bludgeoning, slashing, thunder, fire damage; very fast flying speed; very dangerous tail stinger; long neck can dart down while flying to attack at long range; extremely aggressive when threatened
          </p>
          <h4 class="bestiary-heading4">Weaknesses</h4>
          <p>
            Vulnerable to cold damage; far slower and more vulnerable while on the ground; weighted nets or firmly anchored bear traps may be able to keep it grounded
          </p>
          <h4 class="bestiary-heading4">Peculiarities</h4>
          <p>
            Although warm-blooded, wyverns are poorly insulated and prefer to hunt during the day, especially around midday; wyvern venom, birthwort and  white gull to create an antivenom; lacking true antivenom, golden oriole should be used instead

          <h4 class="bestiary-heading4">About</h4>
          <p>
            Wyverns are voracious and highly aggressive winged draconids that prefer to dive down upon prey from a great height and snatch it in their claws. Much like a tortoise in the claws of an eagle, those caught by a wyvern will soon find themselves lifted to a great height and bourn away to some lofty nest where they are dropped to dash against the rocks. The wyvern can then pick the - often still living - victim apart at its leisure, feeding morsels to their hatchlings.
          </p>
          <p>
            One of the wyvern's distinctive characteristics that set it apart from other draconids is their tail. The long tail of a wyvern ends in a foot-long razor sharp hollow spine, that can inject an excruciatingly painful venom into those it pierces. Should one be struck by the tail-spine, their death is almost certain, unless they have access to the correct antivenom.
