Driven by base instinct, they hunt by night for unwary livestock, or unfortunate travellers to drain of blood, latching on with claws and wings and refusing to dislodge until they have drunk their fill. Although a single Plumard is little threat to even an untrained peasant with a net, Plumards swarm together in flocks that may range in size from barely ten to over sixty. When hunting together, the flock will overwhelm even larger victims with sheer numbers, so many creatures latching on to their prey that the unfortunate victim may not even be able to stand under their combined weight. Against such numbers, it may be necessary to find other ways of dealing with a flock instead of confronting them head-on, as every Plumard felled will be quickly replaced by many more.","Since they cannot endure the light of the sun for long, a flock of Plumards hunts in only a relatively small area around their lair, which by necessity will be some dark, sunless corner of a cave or building.

Although not venomous, its tail is heavy and spiked and can easily break one's body with a single strike. Their huge jaws can swallow prey whole, and their wings can be used offensively, striking with sharp bone spurs to ward off attackers while on the ground. Above all however, it is their fiery breath that makes the Slyzard so dangerous. While not as devastating as the breath of a true Red Dragon, the heat from their breath can easily roast a knight in their armour, or turn a village into ash.","They have rarely been observed eating raw sulphur, firmly disproving any notions of killing them with sulphur-stuffed carcasses, as folktales would have one do with Dragons.

An umber hulk will often burrow through the walls of basements and cellars, finding a warm, dry chamber filled with food. Any poor fool who stumbles upon the creature, or finds their way into the tunnels does not last long.","When attacking, the hulk uses the short but powerful claws on its forelimbs to harass its victim, while moving in to finish them with its huge mandibles. The most dangerous part of the creature however, is the eyes, as these can generate a powerful hypnotic effect that muddles even keen minds. Simply averting one's eyes is enough to avoid this, however that in turn makes fighting the beast difficult.
