Unlike more refined Greater Vampires, Ekimmara do not sip blood from delicate puncture wounds, but slash open the arteries of their prey and lap up the blood wherever it sprays, often even ignoring the dying victim in their haste to taste the fresh-spilt blood.

This also explains their aversion to thunderstorms, during which they prefer to lurk in whatever dark lair they have found for themselves. It should be noted that Ekimmaras are more social than many other Vampires, both Lesser and Greater, who usually hunt alone.

When not in the air, their powerful wings are used to crawl along the ground or climb at surprising speed, and retain enough dexterity to hook open windows or doors.","Although still dangerous in combat, the Fleder prefers to avoid direct confrontation, using its flight and stealth to come upon sleeping victims to drink from. The bite of a Fleder injects a soporific venom which ensures the prey does not wake from sleep, however against an already awake foe, the venom merely causes drowsiness and disorientation. After biting a sleeping animal or person, the Fleder feeds until satiated, slurping blood from the jagged wound created by its long fangs. Bites are usually made over the heart, although may also occur on the neck, wrist or ankle. Victims rarely survive being fed upon by a Felder, although in a few cases, particularly sturdy victims have been found the next morning still alive, emaciated from extreme blood loss. Recovery is rare however and medical attention is required at once.","If unable to find a sleeping victim (or if the victim awakens before bitten) the Fleder is more than capable of simply overpowering its prey and incapacitating it with a powerful bite to the throat. A Fleder hunting in this manner will usually try to swoop down from above and knock the prey to the ground, pinning it and killing it quickly. They are wary creatures and will quickly attempt to escape if the victim cannot be quicky silenced or manages to injure the Fleder. Like other Vampires, the Fleder is quite at home in cities, where it has a large stock of potential victims.

In juveniles, these whips may be only a foot long, but in adults can measure up to six feet long, and strike with deadly, accuracy, opening terrible slashing wounds and cause horrible bleeding. Strikes with this tail is the Forktail's preferred method of attack, usually severing a vital artery, allowing the Forktail to remain airborne until the prey has bled out.","Unlike Wyverns, the Forktail has a short neck and legs, and they rarely carry their prey aloft, instead alighting nearby once their prey is dead and tearing chunks from the carcass. They are also more social animals than many Draconids, commonly forming mated pairs, or even larger groups, which hunt together and share kills.

They possess leathery wings that stretch between their lower torso and wrists but unlike the Fleder, they retain their clawed hands and bipedal movement. Due to this their wings are not strong enough for true flight, but allow the Garkain to glide between trees or rooftops, and dive from above to land upon unsuspecting prey. Once on the ground, the Garkain reverts to aggressive attacks with claws and teeth, using their powerful legs to leap onto victims and crush them to the ground. An unusual feature of the Garkain is the ability to project terrifying hallucinations directly into the mind of their prey using two fleshy glands on either side of their wide skull. Victims who succumb to these visions may freeze in terror, or attempt to flee, both response leaving them vulnerable to the Garkain.

The extraction of these organs - and any other the creature may feel inclined to devour - is extremely messy, with little precision. The Garkain tears open its victims, snapping bones with brute strength, and hooks out chosen organs with short, powerful claws. In almost all observed cases, the intestines were torn out, but not consumed. Once fed, the Garkain may leave the remains where they lie, although they sometimes drag the corpse back to their lair, for future consumption. Although originally found in forests and mountainous areas, the Garkain - like many other vampires - has adapted well to hunting in larger cities, where tall buildings provide perfect vantage points to drop onto victims below.","The Garkain differs from its kin in several other ways. They do not possess the innate rapid regeneration displayed by Ekimmaras and Fleders (and all Greater Vampires), although in turn they are exceptionally hardy, shrugging off wounds from steel blades with barely a scratch. A wounded Garkain will instead enter a state of torpor during the day, hidden in its lair, during which it will heal wounds at an increased rate. The creature is vulnerable in this state though, its senses dulled as it expends energy on healing. Another notable difference is that Garkains are less afraid of the sun than some of their brethren, although they are still nocturnal. The sunlight hurts their sharp eyes, and interferes with their ability to produce visions of terror in prey, but their fearsome strength is otherwise unchanged."]},ghast:{active:!0,name:"Ghast",image:t("Ghast.webp"),category:a.necrophage,type:i.aberration,size:n.medium,overview:["Pale, hairless biped on powerful hind legs with large flat, three-toed feet.

In these numbers, they pose significant threat to even the most hardened warriors should they choose to attack. Luckily, ghouls are generally wary creatures that prefer to scavenge from rotten corpses, though if unable to find carrion they may hunt more aggressively.

However, Ghoul packs are often brought under the sway of stronger and more intelligent Necrophages, who may drive them to far bolder attacks and proactive hunting.","When required to hunt live prey, the Ghouls' claws possess a strong paralytic venom that rapidly immobilising limbs and eventually the entire body of the victim, allowing the Ghoul to feed on the still-living creature.

Although a single Plumard is little threat to even an untrained peasant with a net, Plumards swarm together in flocks that may range in size from barely ten to over sixty. When hunting together, the flock will overwhelm even larger victims with sheer numbers, so many creatures latching on to their prey that the unfortunate victim may not even be able to stand under their combined weight. Against such numbers, it may be necessary to find other ways of dealing with a flock instead of confronting them head-on, as every Plumard felled will be quickly replaced by many more.","Since they cannot endure the light of the sun for long, a flock of Plumards hunts in only a relatively small area around their lair, which by necessity will be some dark, sunless corner of a cave or building. If a flock becomes large enough that the area cannot support their feeding requirements, the flock may migrate - sometimes splitting into multiple groups - to find new territory."]},slyzard:{active:!0,name:"Slyzard",image:t("Slyzard.webp"),category:a.draconid,type:i.dragon,size:n.huge,overview:["Aerial biped with sharp, three-toed claws.

Unlike Dragons however, the Slyzard is not truly intelligent, and is extremely aggressive, seeing all creatures as prey. They have enlarged adrenal glands and an extremely high pain tolerance, causing them to act with unrelenting fearlessness. Once engaged, a Slyzard will not flee, but will fight bitterly until either it or its opponents are dead.","When not mistake for a Dragon, the Slyzard can be confused with the Wyvern or Forktail by the layman, but this is a dangerous error for the Slyzard is far more dangerous than its smaller relatives. Although not venomous, its tail is heavy and spiked and can easily break one's body with a single strike. Their huge jaws can swallow prey whole, and their wings can be used offensively, striking with sharp bone spurs to ward off attackers while on the ground. Above all however, it is their fiery breath that makes the Slyzard so dangerous. While not as devastating as the breath of a true Red Dragon, the heat from their breath can easily roast a knight in their armour, or turn a village into ash.","They have rarely been observed eating raw sulphur, firmly disproving any notions of killing them with sulphur-stuffed carcasses, as folktales would have one do with Dragons.

An umber hulk will often burrow through the walls of basements and cellars, finding a warm, dry chamber filled with food. Any poor fool who stumbles upon the creature, or finds their way into the tunnels does not last long.","When attacking, the hulk uses the short but powerful claws on its forelimbs to harass its victim, while moving in to finish them with its huge mandibles. The most dangerous part of the creature however, is the eyes, as these can generate a powerful hypnotic effect that muddles even keen minds. Simply averting one's eyes is enough to avoid this, however that in turn makes fighting the beast difficult.

However this last is far rarer than superstition would have you believe as most bites do not transmit the disease. However it is still a possibility and one especially relevant to those who may encounter and fight lycanthropes often.","In the case of cursed werewolves, there is a possibility of lifting the curse, although as with all curses, it will be likely be unique, and require a unique solution to lift it, if it is at all possible to lift. Those cursed with lycanthropy - rather than being born to it - have little control over their transformation, and are driven by a terrible bloodlust and hunger. Most have no recollection of their actions while under its effects (perhaps a blessing) and only a few with iron wills are able to restrain themselves enough to communicate while transformed.","Regardless of the source of their lycanthropy, each werewolf is invariably unique, as they are humanoids cursed or diseased with a terrible burden. Some may be unwilling hosts to the bloodlust, while others may embrace it, or even deliberately use it to their advantage. Some may be fully lucid during transformation, while others may remember only fragments, or believing the episodes to be vivid dreams.","In combat, a werewolf is very dangerous, and possessed of an apex predator's murderous instincts. They have been recorded to single out weak foes and viciously focus on them until they fall, slowly picking apart a group until the stronger members stand alone. They can leap great distances and seize upon any weakness to strike swiftly, preferring bites to the throat to quickly finish an opponent, although they are said to rip out the hearts of those they kill as well.

The disposition of a Wraith may depend on the reason for its existence. Wraiths born of violent deaths, vengeful rage, unfinished vendettas, or a love of war are likely to be more aggressive, while those lingering from sorrows, lost loves, unfinished business, or unresolved trauma may be communicative and non-hostile. In this way, Wraiths - like many Spectres - exhibit considerable overlap with Cursed Ones, as many can be dealt with by resolving their reason for lingering. They can of course also be the direct product of a curse, which may bind a Wraith to this world long after they are ready to move on. If a Wraith is not cooperative, it may need to be defeated first, to dispel it for long enough for you to work.","Wraiths - more so than other Spectres - are directly bound to earthly remains, unable to stray too far from them. They still have a substantial range, enough to haunt a village or city quarter, or area of woodland but cannot for travel to a different city or village for example. Within this range, the Wraith can move at will, both moving through solid objects with ease and even vanishing in place, only to reappear somewhere else. They prefer to linger in places of personal significance (most commonly their resting place), and can be compelled to stay in one place by invoking memories from life, usually through belongings, scents, etc.","In addition to this, a Wraith may not always be physically manifest, instead resting in a form of sleep-like trance, completely invisible and undetectable to the human eye. They can be woken simply by speaking to them, or intruding upon their resting place, but a silver bell and their name can be used to compel them to reveal themselves even against their will. This is not to be confused with Necromancy. The Wraith is not summoned up from death, but merely woken from their resting place to converse with the caller. As a final note of caution, one may be tempted to simply destroy the remains of a Wraith, thinking that this will force it to move on. This would be a grave error. Destroying a Wraith's physical remains merely strips it of the little humanity it had left, leaving an undead husk that will return in time as another, more twisted form of Spectre, no longer to be reasoned with."]},wyvern:{active:!0,name:"Wyvern",image:t("Wyvern.webp"),category:a.draconid,type:i.dragon,size:n.large,overview:["Aerial biped with sharp, three-toed claws.
