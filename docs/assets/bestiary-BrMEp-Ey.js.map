Some may be fully lucid during transformation, while others may remember only fragments, or believing the episodes to be vivid dreams.\", \"In combat, a werewolf is very dangerous, and possessed of an apex predator's murderous instincts.

The wraith is already bound to a location, near its body and cannot roam too far beyond that, no matter the lure. Items, smells, sounds etc. that were important to the wraith in life, or are related to its reason for lingering can potentially attract it and keep it present for a time.\"],\r\n        harvesting: [\"Essence of Death\", \"Grave Dirt\"],\r\n        about: [\"Wraiths are the quintessential Spectre, a deceased humanoid that has for whatever reason, been unable to pass on in peace, instead lingering and haunting the final resting place of their material bodies. The disposition of a Wraith may depend on the reason for its existence. Wraiths born of violent deaths, vengeful rage, unfinished vendettas, or a love of war are likely to be more aggressive, while those lingering from sorrows, lost loves, unfinished business, or unresolved trauma may be communicative and non-hostile. In this way, Wraiths - like many Spectres - exhibit considerable overlap with Cursed Ones, as many can be dealt with by resolving their reason for lingering. They can of course also be the direct product of a curse, which may bind a Wraith to this world long after they are ready to move on. If a Wraith is not cooperative, it may need to be defeated first, to dispel it for long enough for you to work.\", \"Wraiths - more so than other Spectres - are directly bound to earthly remains, unable to stray too far from them. They still have a substantial range, enough to haunt a village or city quarter, or area of woodland but cannot for travel to a different city or village for example. Within this range, the Wraith can move at will, both moving through solid objects with ease and even vanishing in place, only to reappear somewhere else. They prefer to linger in places of personal significance (most commonly their resting place), and can be compelled to stay in one place by invoking memories from life, usually through belongings, scents, etc.\", \"In addition to this, a Wraith may not always be physically manifest, instead resting in a form of sleep-like trance, completely invisible and undetectable to the human eye. They can be woken simply by speaking to them, or intruding upon their resting place, but a silver bell and their name can be used to compel them to reveal themselves even against their will. This is not to be confused with Necromancy. The Wraith is not summoned up from death, but merely woken from their resting place to converse with the caller. As a final note of caution, one may be tempted to simply destroy the remains of a Wraith, thinking that this will force it to move on. This would be a grave error. Destroying a Wraith's physical remains merely strips it of the little humanity it had left, leaving an undead husk that will return in time as another, more twisted form of Spectre, no longer to be reasoned with.\"]\r\n    },\r\n    wyvern:\r\n    {\r\n        active: true,\r\n        name: \"Wyvern\",\r\n        image: GetImage(\"Wyvern.webp\"),\r\n        category: categories.draconid.name,\r\n        type: types.dragon,\r\n        size: sizes.large,\r\n        overview: [\"Aerial biped with sharp, three-toed claws.
