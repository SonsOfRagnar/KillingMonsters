In rare cases, their curse may have been passed on from parent to child, or from attacker to victim through a wound. Due to the powerfully magical nature of Cursed Ones, one should take care to approach each case individually, being wary of assumptions or past experiences. Some curses may follow reliable patterns - such as that of the Striga - but even then some details may vary, along with the strength of the curse.","Many cases can be cured through the proper dispelling of the curse. Some curses have known cures, although enacting them may be tricky, while others often require the meeting of certain conditions unique to the circumstances under which the afflicted was cursed. Gathering information on how they came to be cursed is often vital.","If all else fails, death is the surest cure, although it may not come easily to them, as their curses often bestow terrible strength upon them."]},draconid:{name:"Draconid",pluralName:"Draconids",overview:["Dragon. No other monster is as far-famed or feared as the Dragon. Peasants tell tales of their wrath, kings stitch them on their banners, all covet their legendary hoards of treasure. Despite their extreme lethality, the vast majority of true Dragons have been hunted to near extinction by royal armies, huge bands of hunters, and mages seeking their potent blood and organs.","Indeed, although they are related, the majority of Draconids are not true Dragons, and many are extremely different. They are however often confused or conflated with Dragons by the uneducated, and by braggarts quick to claim they have slain a Dragon. The Draconids are a broad family of quasi-reptiles that encompasses terrestrial, aerial, and aquatic species.","Aerial species are the most numerous - and often most dangerous - of these, roosting in mountain caves, rocky crags, cliff-faces, and occasionally ruined structures. Herd animals, particularly sheep, are their most common prey, and are snatched boldly from fields and pens."]},necrophage:{name:"Necrophage",pluralName:"Necrophages",overview:["Translating literally as 'Corpse Eaters', these are monsters that feed on the dead, particularly humanoid corpses. Their presence in graveyards and on old battlefields - along with their name - has given rise to the erroneous belief that Necrophages themselves are dead creatures reanimated from the corpses of the slain. This is of course nonsense. Unlike Specters, Necrophages are living creatures that while preternatural, have found an ecological niche as scavengers and carrion-eaters.","They are drawn to death, particularly large burial grounds, mass graves, and sites of battle, where they can sustain themselves for months on the corpses found there. Necrophages often tolerate others of their kind and many are able to display social behaviour when advantageous, hunting in packs when carrion is unavailable, and forming communal feeding grounds for mutual protection. Several species of Necrophage may coexist in a location, and sometimes Necrophages follow other monsters or beasts to scavenge from their discarded kills.","As buried corpses are a common food source, digging or burrowing is a commonly reported behaviour. Necrophages are nourished by consuming rotting corpses, and when injured, have been observed to devour those who fall fighting them to recoup their strength and vigor. For this reason, it is often advisable to engage the creatures on ground of your choose, rather than in their carrion-filled lairs."]},relict:{name:"Relict",pluralName:"Relicts",overview:["Relicts are ancient beings, the last remains of dying species, driven to the brink of extinction by the long march of time, and the relentless expansion of civilisation. While they may once have been numerous, these creatures are now among the rarest monsters encountered, which combined with the mystery surrounding their origins, leads many simple folk to believe them to be gods ruling over deep woodlands, or demons sent up from some burning hell.","There is great variety among relicts, with many of them being truly unique, and many of them sapient beings. Great caution is advised when hunting any relict, as even known species may have unique variations, skills, or knowledge from their long lives. Additionally, it is worth noting that there are many relicts that seem to pose little threat, and may even be benevolent in their own way, something worth considering before setting out to kill one.","Despite their magical nature, relicts are incredibly resilient against both steel and silver weaponry, only being truly threatened by blades deeply imbued with magic."]}},o={aberration:"Aberration",dragon:"Dragon",humanoid:"Humanoid",monstrosity:"Monstrosity"},r={medium:"Medium",large:"Large"},h={template:{active:!1,name:"Template",image:"",category:n.cursed.name,type:o.humanoid,size:r.medium,overview:[""],strengths:"",weaknesses:"",peculiarities:"",lures:[""],harvesting:[""],about:[""]},catoblepas:{active:!0,name:"Catoblepas",image:"../assets/images/bestiary/Catoblepas.png",category:n.necrophage.name,type:o.monstrosity,size:r.large,overview:["Stocky, shaggy-haired quadruped with cloven hooves and high shoulders.

Although it possesses large tusks, these are for rooting through graves and corpses, looking for the choicest part, typically the large and small intestines.","Instead the Catoblepas will use its powerful tail club to attack any who manage to approach, a difficult task in the first place due to the nauseating and disease-bearing stench that emanates from the beast. If this initial attack fails, the creature will rear its cumbersome neck and open its third eye, which can melt flesh from bone and necrotise tissue in an instant. Superstitious peasants say that its eye is a window into some distant hell, but more rational minds theorise that the Catoblepas simply possesses a powerful magical ability.","While it lacks the natural burrowing abilities of many Necrophages, the Catoblepas is at home in swamps and marshes, and can sink deep into mud and murky pools to conceal itself while it sleeps between meals."]},ghast:{active:!0,name:"Ghast",image:"/images/bestiary/Ghast.webp",category:n.necrophage.name,type:o.aberration,size:r.medium,overview:["Pale, hairless biped on powerful hind legs with large flat, three-toed feet.

They seem to have slipped through into our world later than their relatives, and possess human-level intellects. They also seem adapted for predation on human and non-human communities, able to take on the forms of most humanoid corpses that they consume. The ghast then lurks in the community for up to three months - the maximum extent of the transformation - before searching for a new victim. While still disguised, the ghast will often proactively seek out a suitable target, stalk them, and kill them, before taking on their shape and life.","The ghast's transformation takes place over the course of an hour, during which the ghast's flesh bubbles and stretches, a new layer of skin growing over the old. The transformation is more than skin deep however, with the creature taking on the voice and some memories of the victim as well as their form. Once transformed, the ghast may shed its outer layer in an emergency, slithering out of it like a new-birthed foal.","When in their natural shape, the ghast moves by hopping on its powerful hind legs, and can make incredible leaps for its size. Like many other necrophages, it emits a powerful corpse-stink, poisonous to those around it, while its claws secrete a paralytic grease that freezes the muscle of those it strikes. It is also unusually fearless, perhaps as a result of its intelligence, and cannot be easily frightened, save by bunches of dried thistles, which it desperately avoids."]},meijersBasilisk:{active:!0,name:"Meijer's Basilisk",image:"./assets/images/bestiary/MeijerBasilisk.png",category:n.draconid.name,type:o.monstrosity,size:r.medium,overview:["Long-bodied eight-legged lizard with wide four-toed claws and a leathery hide, usually slate grey or blue.

However, this should not be mistaken for an easy kill, the eyes of the creature are terrible, and should one look upon them, one's body shall rapidly begin to turn to stone.","They can also be difficult to track, as they climb well, and prefer to stick to rocky outcrops where they may lie camouflaged against the stone.

However it is still a possibility and one especially relevant to those who may encounter and fight lycanthropes often.","In the case of cursed werewolves, there is a possibility of lifting the curse, although as with all curses, it will be likely be unique, and require a unique solution to lift it, if it is at all possible to lift.","Regardless of the source of their lycanthropy, each werewolf is invariably unique, as they are humanoids cursed or diseased with a terrible burden.
