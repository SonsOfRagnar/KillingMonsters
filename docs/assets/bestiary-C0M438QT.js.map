Lycanthropes may be either direct results of a magical Curse, born as the offspring of two lycanthropes, or infected when bitten by one already afflicted by lycanthropy. However this last is far rarer than superstition would have you believe as most bites do not transmit the disease. However it is still a possibility and one especially relevant to those who may encounter and fight lycanthropes often.\", \"In the case of cursed werewolves, there is a possibility of lifting the curse, although as with all curses, it will be likely be unique, and require a unique solution to lift it, if it is at all possible to lift.\", \"Regardless of the source of their lycanthropy, each werewolf is invariably unique, as they are humanoids cursed or diseased with a terrible burden. Some may be unwilling hosts to the bloodlust, while others may embrace it, or even deliberately use it to their advantage. Some may be fully lucid during transformation, while others may remember only fragments, or believing the episodes to be vivid dreams.\"]\r\n        },\r\n        wyvern:\r\n        {\r\n\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default BestiarySource;","import '../scss/styles.scss';\r\nimport * as bootstrap from 'bootstrap';\r\nimport BestiarySource from '../bestiarySource.js';\r\n\r\nconsole.log(\"Bestiary script running.\");\r\n\r\nconsole.log(BestiarySource);\r\n\r\n/**\r\n * Toggles the OffCanvas functionality in the bestiary when pressing the button. \r\n * Used to prevent issue where closing the offcanvas scrolls back to the button.\r\n */\r\ndocument.addEventListener(\"DOMContentLoaded\", function() {\r\n    var myOffcanvas = document.getElementById('offcanvasResponsive-bestiary');\r\n\r\n    // Exit function if we don't find the correct offcanvas, meaning we are on the wrong page.\r\n    if (myOffcanvas == null)\r\n    {\r\n        console.log(\"No offCanvas found!\");\r\n        return;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    var bsOffcanvas = new bootstrap.Offcanvas(myOffcanvas);\r\n\r\n    console.log(\"event listener added\");\r\n\r\n    document.getElementById(\"btn-open-bestiary-offcanvas\").addEventListener('click',function (e) {\r\n\r\n        console.log(\"Event listner triggered.\");\r\n\r\n        e.preventDefault();\r\n        e.stopPropagation();\r\n        bsOffcanvas.toggle();\r\n    });\r\n});"],"names":["categories","types","BestiarySource","myOffcanvas","bsOffcanvas","bootstrap.Offcanvas","e"],"mappings":"gDAAA,MAAMA,EACN,CACI,OAAQ,aAIZ,EAEMC,EACN,CAUI,SAAU,UAKd,EAEMC,EACN,CACI,QACA,CACI,SACA,CACI,KAAM,WACN,MAAO,GACP,SAAUF,EAAW,OACrB,KAAMC,EAAM,SACZ,KAAM,SACN,SAAU,GACV,UAAW,GACX,WAAY,GACZ,cAAe,GACf,MAAO,GACP,WAAY,GACZ,MAAO,EACV,EACD,SACA,CACI,KAAM,WACN,MAAO,iCACP,SAAUD,EAAW,OACrB,KAAMC,EAAM,SACZ,KAAM,SACN,SAAU,wYACV,UAAW,gPACX,WAAY,gHACZ,cAAe,6SACf,MAAO,CAAC,2CAA4C,iCAAiC,EACrF,WAAY,CAAC,2BAA4B,iCAAiC,EAC1E,MAAO,CAAC,ohBAAqhB,uNAAwN,uZAAuZ,CAC/oC,EACD,OACA,CAEC,CACJ,CAEL,EC9DA,QAAQ,IAAI,0BAA0B,EAEtC,QAAQ,IAAIC,CAAc,EAM1B,SAAS,iBAAiB,mBAAoB,UAAW,CACrD,IAAIC,EAAc,SAAS,eAAe,8BAA8B,EAGxE,GAAIA,GAAe,KACnB,CACI,QAAQ,IAAI,qBAAqB,EACjC,MACH,CAED,IAAIC,EAAc,IAAIC,EAAoBF,CAAW,EAErD,QAAQ,IAAI,sBAAsB,EAElC,SAAS,eAAe,6BAA6B,EAAE,iBAAiB,QAAQ,SAAUG,EAAG,CAEzF,QAAQ,IAAI,0BAA0B,EAEtCA,EAAE,eAAc,EAChBA,EAAE,gBAAe,EACjBF,EAAY,OAAM,CAC1B,CAAK,CACL,CAAC"}
